# Hand Sign Recognition ML Project

This is a machine learning project for real-time hand sign recognition using computer vision and deep learning.

## Project Guidelines:
- Use OpenCV for camera capture and image processing
- Use MediaPipe for hand landmark detection
- Use TensorFlow/Keras for the neural network model
- Focus on real-time performance and accuracy
- Maintain clean, modular code structure
- Include comprehensive error handling
- Use modern GUI frameworks for user interface
